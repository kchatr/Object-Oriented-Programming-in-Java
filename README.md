# Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java

This Java project intends to demonstrate several core Object Oriented Programming principles, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
__Object Oriented Programming__ is one of the most popular and important programming methodologies. Object Oritented Programming (OOP) is focused around _classes_ which are the blueprints in creating _objects_. Objects are synonymous to real-life objects (both tangible and intangible), having an identity, attributes, and behaviour. OOP is centered around the creation of classes and interfaces, which are then used in the initalization of objects. It is a programming style that makes programming closer to thinking about the real world.

This project was created for Google Code-in 2019 :)
