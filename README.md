# Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java

This Java project intends to demonstrate several core Object Oriented Programming principles, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
Object Oriented Programming is one of the most popular and important programming methodologies and philosiphies. Object Oritented Programming (OOP) is focused around _classes_ which are the blueprints in creating _objects_. Objects are practiacally identical to real-life objects (both tangible and intangible), having an identity, attributes, and behaviour. OOP is a programming style that makes programming closer to thinking about the real world.

This project was created for Google Code-in 2019 :)
